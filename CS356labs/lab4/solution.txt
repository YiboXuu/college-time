for assignment part 1:
SELECT * FROM account WHERE username = ' OR 1=1; --


this can help us to get into the table account without the name, and we still can get “Successful login” from sqli() function.



for assignment part2:
SELECT * FROM account WHERE username = '; DELETE FROM account; --


this can help us to delete the all record from the table account.





python code:


def sqli():
    u_name = str(input("Enter Username\t"))
    print("Enter Password:\t")
    p_word = getpass()
    #sanitize u_name and p_word here. You are free to do it your way.
    obj = " "
    if u_name.find(";") >0 or u_name.find(obj) > 0  :
        print("Failed login1")
    else:
        try:
            c.execute("SELECT username, password FROM account WHERE username='%s' AND password='%s'" %(u_name, p_word))
        except:
            c.executescript("SELECT username, password FROM account WHERE username='%s' AND password='%s'" %(u_name, p_word))
        if c.fetchone():
            print("Successful login")
        else:
            print("Failed login")
sqli()
